# `barn`

Build all React Native artifacts (`.ipa`, `.apk`, `.jsbundle`) with a single command:

```shell
barn build
```

`barn` aggressively parallelizes tasks and tries to cache _everything_, aiming to reduce buildtimes as much as possible.

## Disclaimer

This tool is in early stages of development yet and is probably unusable for most projects except my own. Really, **DON'T USE IT YET**.

If it works out well, though, I'll be ready to make `barn` a production-ready tool.
